there are 4 .c files -
parta.c (contains the basic shell)
partb.c (contains the pipe (|) operator)
partb2.c (contains &&)
partc.c (contains > redirection (with &&))

to run the .c files-
$gcc parta.c
$./a.out

in order to exit the bash, type exit
**IMPORTANT**
for parts b1, b2 and c : 
It is important to seperate everything by spaces , even "|" and "&&" because of the way
parsiing is done in my implemenation
example: 
>ps -aux | grep bash
will work
but,
>ps -aux|grep bash
will not work 


All basic functionalities are working but there is a known bug- exit sometimes doesn't work at once, I suspect it is because of garbage in buffer of previous command
